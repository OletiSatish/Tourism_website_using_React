## ðŸš€ Running the Tourism Web Application

Follow the steps below to install dependencies and start the application:

### 1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have **Node.js** installed. Then, install all necessary dependencies by running the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application in **development mode**. By default, the app will be available at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Additional Information
- **Hot Reloading:** The development server includes hot reloading, so any changes you make to the code will automatically reflect in the browser.
- **Custom Ports:** If you need to run the application on a different port, you can modify the port in the `package.json` or environment configuration.
